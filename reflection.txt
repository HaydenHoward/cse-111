Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
During the chemistry assignment I saw how important having a function can be.
Having parameters in the function made it so the function could be used in different 
situations that need it. Using functions made following the code and the process it 
took to complete all the code much easier. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions are useful for functions that return a value. These fucntions are able 
to test every possible scenorio that you can think of and confirm that it returns the 
correct results. For functions that don't return a value can still be tested by having 
it return True. Test functions are a valuable thing that I have been able to learn this semester. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
When troubleshooting a program using the debugging tool within VSCode is a very useful 
resource. Another way that I can go about solving it is trying to write a test function for it.
The last way that I know of to help fix a program is go to the internet and research to find 
possible solutions for my problem. One thing I could do to improve my process is to write the
test functions as i am coding instead of after I have finished the code. This will give me a
clearer answer to if my fucntions are running correctly. Then when I come across a function
that does not run correctly I can then use the debugging tool to try and find where the error is myself.
